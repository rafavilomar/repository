            I got to know the world of development when I was 14â€“15 years old,
            since then my curiosity has led me to learn more and more. At 16, I
            finished my high school studies as a computer technician and at 18 I
            finished my studies in ITLA as a Software Developer.

            Lately I have dedicated my time to research about design,
